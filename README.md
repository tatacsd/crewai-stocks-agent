# üìà Crewai Stocks Analysis
This project is a stock market analysis tool that leverages machine learning and financial data APIs to generate insightful stock trend analyses and news summaries. Built using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models, it fetches stock prices, analyzes news, and creates a comprehensive newsletter for stock analysis.

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning and AI classes from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)

## üöÄ Features

- **Stock Price Retrieval**: Fetches the last year's stock prices using the `yfinance` API.
- **News Analysis**: Finds the latest news about the stock and evaluates the market sentiment (fear or greed).
- **AI-Generated Report**: Creates a concise report including price trends, news summaries, and a fear/greed score using AI agents.
- **Interactive Web App**: Built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to input a stock ticker and get real-time analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Stock Price Retrieval**: Enter a stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple), and the app fetches the last year of stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
   
2. **Trend Analysis**: An AI agent evaluates the stock‚Äôs price history to identify if the price is trending up, down, or remaining stable.

3. **News Sentiment Analysis**: Another AI agent searches for the latest news about the stock and provides a sentiment analysis (fear or greed).

4. **Report Generation**: The final AI agent synthesizes the stock price trend and news sentiment into a brief, three-paragraph newsletter-style report.
